## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. Create `.env`

You can use the following defaults or override them:

```env
REDIS_HOST=redis
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=
REDIS_DB=0
PORT=8080
APP_DEBUG=true
LOG_TO_FILE=true
LOG_FILE_PATH=logs/app.log
LOG_ERROR_FILE_PATH=logs/app_error.log
```

### 2. Start with Docker

Use the following commands to build and run the server:

```docker
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```
These commands will build the server without using any cache and run it in detached mode.

Server will be available at:
```localhost
http://localhost:8080
```
